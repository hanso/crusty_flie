# crustyflie
This projects goal is to run the Crazyflie 2.1 from Bitcraze on the programming language Rust.
It will do so using the cargo build system and trying to integrate nicely with the Rust ecosystem.
The project main goal is to learn Rust and Cargo.

Using https://github.com/timbod7/rust-stm32f4-examples/blob/master/blinky-hal as reference

## How to debug on Ubuntu 18.10
The debug settings are borrowed from: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart

In a terminal run the following command:
```
openocd -f openocd.cfg
```

This should have a output similar to this:
```

```  
In another terminal run:
```
cargo run
```

This will automatically load the binary and start debugging at main
