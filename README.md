# crustyflie
This projects goal is to run the Crazyflie 2.1 from Bitcraze on the programming language Rust. The project main goal is to lear Rust and Cargo. It will do so using the cargo build system and trying to integrate nicly with the Rust eco system.

Using https://github.com/timbod7/rust-stm32f4-examples/blob/master/blinky-hal as reference

# How to debug on Ubuntu 18.10
The debug settings are borrowed from: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart

In a terminal run the following command:
openocd -f openocd.cfg

This should have a output similar to this:

In another termianal run:
cargo run

This will automatically load the binary and start debugging at main
